# TODO:
# Provide system prompt for Agent. You can use LLM for that but please check properly the generated prompt.
# ---
# To create a system prompt for a User Management Agent, define its role (manage users), tasks
# (CRUD, search, enrich profiles), constraints (no sensitive data, stay in domain), and behavioral patterns
# (structured replies, confirmations, error handling, professional tone). Keep it concise and domain-focused.
# Don't forget that the implementation only with Users Management MCP doesn't have any WEB search!
